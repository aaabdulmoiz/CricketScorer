# CricketScorer
 An app to keep score of cricket matches. This Web Application was made in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MySql and it was my first Web Development Project. The basic idea of the app was to provide cricket teams to keep track of their scores in an easier way and the abilty to challenge other teams registered on the website.

Clicking on the add team, you will be redirected to the page where you will have a form to fill in your team players' names. Also add the team code which is important. Since if someone challenges you in this game, they have to add your teeamcode also so that it can be verified that the match really took place.
